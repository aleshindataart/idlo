EMPOWERING COMMUNITIES THROUGH ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION CENTRES IN SOMALIA|"At Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Centres in Somalia, community-run customary and informal justice mechanisms are helping to resolve civil disputes and minor offenses through a panel of adjudicators.

In a new issue brief, Inclusive Practices in Alternative Dispute Resolution: Delivering People-Centred Justice in Somalia, IDLO draws on its experience providing technical support and capacity development to 15 ADR Centres in Somalia to shed light on the ADR Centres’ operational model and offer key recommendations for strengthening their inclusiveness.

This includes recommendations on boosting the inclusion of women and young people. Under the ADR Somalia programme, women comprise 22% of ADR Centre adjudicators, with six Centres having a woman Deputy Chair and 86% of them employing women community paralegals. The presence of women in these adjudicating roles has contributed to increasing women’s participation during the hearing process and ensuring more gender-sensitive outcomes. Since women paralegals were brought on board, women now make up 50% of the ADR Centres’ justice seekers.

The Deputy Chair of the ADR Centre in the district of Beledweyne in Hirshabelle State, a woman named Dahara, has resolved over 100 cases since joining the Centre two years ago.

“The experience I gained from working with the ADR programme has further enhanced my skills and services for the community,” Dahara told IDLO. “The programme recognized and elevated our status as women within the community.”

Over a period of 15 months, the IDLO-supported ADR Centres received and managed 5,433 cases, with more than 11,000 Somalis directly benefitting from the dispute resolution services and referrals. The Centres also delivered legal awareness sessions to more than 5,000 Somalis including internally displaced persons (IDPs) and local communities in ADR Centre neighbourhoods.
The ADR Somalia programme was implemented by IDLO from January 2019 to December 2021 and from July 2022 to September 2023 in partnership with Somalia’s Federal Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs (MOJ) and the MOJs of the Federal Member States of Galmudug, Hirshabelle, Jubaland, Puntland and Southwest, and supported by the Government of the Netherlands.

CLIMATE JUSTICE FOR SIDS: A RULE OF LAW-CENTRED APPROACH FOR TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE ACTION|"Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have been at the forefront of the global climate action agenda for over three decades. While their high exposure to the effects of climate change poses critical risks to the long-term prospects for sustainable development on their islands, climate champions from the Caribbean, the Pacific and the Atlantic, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean and South China Sea (AIMS) have pioneered transformative legal and policy initiatives at the international level – from advocating for reforms to the international financial architecture, to initiating an advisory opinion on climate change at the world’s highest court, the International Court of Justice. Despite this, SIDS still face significant challenges when it comes to climate-resilient development, including the availability and access of much-needed climate finance, the unique geographical challenges facing archipelagic SIDS, and a lack of urgency at the global level with respect to climate action efforts.

The Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for SIDS (ABAS) underlines the importance of the rule of law and equal access to fair justice systems in fostering safe, healthy and prosperous societies – and these principles are also vital enablers of climate justice for SIDS in this critical decade. The rule of law incorporates the substantive element of justice, which emphasizes equality, fairness and non-discrimination, and includes a commitment to democratic principles and good governance. Strengthening the rule of law can empower a diversity of rights-holders on the frontlines of the climate crisis to realize their rights and actively participate in governance and decision-making, while ensuring that institutions have the necessary tools to advance climate-resilient development – including through leveraging public and private financing, and ensuring fair and impactful responses to loss and damage at all levels.

This discussion will contribute to the implementation of the ABAS programme of action by addressing the importance of SDG16 and its core elements of the rule of law and access to justice, as well as its interlinkages with other SDGs, in promoting environmental protection and planetary sustainability. It will focus on the role of the rule of law in building strong and well-funded institutions that can respond to the increasing risk of climate change, and its potential to empower rights-holders to work towards gender equality, intergenerational justice, and a just transition to a sustainable and secure future. A diverse community of stakeholders will analyse the challenges from previous programmes of action, identify concrete solutions in the context of the ABAS, and discuss tools and mechanisms to effectively secure sustainable partnerships for stronger engagements. It will address the following questions:

What is the contribution of the rule of law and SDG16 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in achieving the objectives of the ABAS programme of action and promoting long-term peace and security?
How can institutions, particularly the justice sector, be strengthened in order to deliver climate justice at the national, regional and global levels, and what legal and policy initiatives have shown promise in promoting transformative action?
How can developing effective institutions and global governance in line with SDG16 be used to promote and facilitate investments for SIDS, particularly for enabling local institutions to leverage funding and increase access to sustainable financing for climate action at all levels – including in relation to loss and damage?
What are best practices that have shown promising results for the legal empowerment of rights-holders, including women and girls and young people?"|tag2
